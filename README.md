- 👋 Hi, I’m @batiyilmaz, a social, cognitive and affective neuroscience (SCAN) M.Sc. graduate with a background in psychology.
- 🧠 I’m highly interested in computational cognitive neuroscience (focusing on visual perception) and experimental psychology -- not to mention neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence which makes me very excited for delving into more each day!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to implement EEG+fMRI+eye-tracking fusion data analysis in an extensive manner using machine learning techniques and the combination of univariate and multivariate analysis methods.
- 🤝 For the future, I’m looking to collaborate on any experimentally-driven and biologically-plausible modeling projects (especially using neurally-inspired deep neural networks).
- 📫 You can reach out to me via batiyilmaz4@gmail.com
- 🎵 P.S. I'm also an avid lifelong learner, maker, listener, and collector of music, which makes me an enthusiast when it comes to psychoacoustics and music cognition as well!
