- 👋 Hi, I’m @batiyilmaz, an avid lifelong learner and explorer! I'm a social, cognitive and affective neuroscience (SCAN) M.Sc. student at Freie Universität Berlin with the background in psychology.
- 👀 I’m highly interested in computational cognitive neuroscience (focusing on visual perception) and experimental psychology! Not to mention neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence which makes me very excited to delve into more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to implement EEG and EEG+fMRI fusion data analysis methods using machine learning techniques.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on any experimentally-driven and biologically-plausible modeling projects (especially using neurally-inspired deep convolutional neural networks and reinforcement learning).
- 📫 You can reach me at batiyilmaz4@gmail.com
- 🎵 P.S. I'm also an avid lifelong learner, listener, and collector of music, which makes me an enthusiast when it comes to psychoacoustics and music cognition as well!
