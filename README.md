- 👋 Hi, I’m @batiyilmaz, a cognitive neuroscience MSc student at FU Berlin with the background in psychology.
- 👀 I’m interested in computational cognitive neuroscience and psychology (also neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning implementing EEG and EEG+fMRI fusion data analysis methods using machine learning techniques.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on any experimentally-driven and biologically-plausible modeling projects.
