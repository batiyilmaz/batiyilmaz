- 👋 Hi, I’m @batiyilmaz, a Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN) M.Sc. graduate with a background in psychology.
- 🧠 I’m highly interested in computational cognitive neuroscience (focusing on visual perception) -- not to mention neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence which makes me very excited for delving into more each day!
- 🔬 I have a particular focus on multivariate pattern analysis using cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to EEG.
- 🌱 I’ve been learning and practicing the implementation of EEG + fMRI + DNN fusion data analysis extensively using machine learning techniques using multivariate analysis methods.
- 🤝 For the future, I’m looking to collaborate on experimentally-driven and biologically plausible modeling projects (especially using neurally-inspired deep neural networks).
- 🏫 I truly love being part of teaching activities, for me, being part of them is an invaluable form of learning. I was a TA for Neuromatch Academy Computational Neuroscience 2023!
- 📄 Since the start of 2024, I have been creating wikis for EEG multivariate pattern analysis, complex Morlet Wavelet convolution as well as machine learning techniques applied to neuroimaging data.
- 💻 I write code in Python, MATLAB, and Bash.
- 🎓 My Google Scholar page: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aO8EfVUAAAAJ&hl=en
- 🎵 P.S. I'm also an avid lifelong learner, maker, listener, and a collector of music, which makes me a psychoacoustics and music cognition enthusiast as well!
